# Summary of the Mythical Man-Month
## Chapter 1 The Tar Pit 
Definition of the Tar Pit: "A complicated or difficult situation or problem."

The author explains that creating a small program can be enjoyable, but developing a large program is like being stuck in a "tar pit." Software development involves writing code, designing systems, debugging, testing, and maintaining the software over time. Each of these tasks is cumbersome, and when combined, they present great difficulty for the programmer.

However, there are still some joys in programming:
1. The sheer joy of creating things.
2. The pleasure of making things that are useful to others.
3. The fascination of building complex, puzzle-like systems with interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles.
4. The joy of learning.
5. The delight of working in a highly flexible and adaptable medium.

Difficulties of the craft:
1. The program must perform perfectly.
2. One’s authority is often insufficient for their responsibilities.
3. Debugging seems never-ending.

Conclusion: Programming is both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with unique joys and challenges.

## Chapter 2 The Mythical Man-Month 

The author begins by explaining the common misconception about the relationship between "man" and "month." For example, if a job can be done in 10 months by 1 person, it is often assumed that it can be done in 1 month by 10 people. However, this is not true for programming. In fact, more time may be needed because additional time and effort are required for communication and coordination among team members. Therefore, it is better to focus on improving the efficiency of the existing team rather than adding more people if the goal is to complete the task earlier.


## Chapter 3 The Surgical Team 

The surgeon 
Chief Programmer - the team leader and key role in the structure
responsible for making all critical design and implementation decisions, writing code, and ensuring quality and consistency throughout the project

The copilot 
Co-Pilot - supports the Chief Programmer by discussing complex issues, performing code reviews, and stepping in to take over tasks when necessary
serves as a sounding board and backup

The administrator 
Project Administrator - Handling administrative tasks
manages the team’s schedule, resources, and all non-coding activities

The Editor
Editor - maintains consistency in documentation, ensuring quality across code comments, manuals, and guides

Two secretaries 
1. The program clerk - maintain technical records (both machine-readable and human-readable files)
2. The toolsmith - maintain basic operations to support the surgeon

The tester 
Tester - focuses exclusively on testing the final product (finding bug) 

The language lawyer 
Language Lawyer - specializes in the technical details of the programming language used, providing expertise on complex language-related issues.

## No silver Bullet 
Complexity 
- reworld processes, interactins, and data are complex and interdependent. So does the software
- software lacks uniformity
  
Conformity 
- software must adapt to arbitrary instances 

Changeability 
- also adaptation due to change in environment 

Invisibility 
- better to be abstract and invisible 

Hopes for silver 
- Despite the challenges mentioned in the book, there's still hopes for silver bullets.However, there isn't a single solution to solve the problem and still keep the above essential properties of software. In other words, the different approaches, such as using OOP, AI, etc, are available but has both pros and cons. Therefore the programmer should try to mediate among diffrent approaches and have better productivity
